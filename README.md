# Project with STM32F103C8
## Project Description
This project demonstrates the functionality of the STM32F103C8 microcontroller with LSM6DS3.
This project demonstrates how to determine spatial orientation using a digital accelerometer and gyroscope  with an STM32 microcontroller. Sensor data is processed and displayed in real-time on a OLED screen via the I2C interface. The program includes a visual representation of motion using dynamic on-screen elements and supports basic user interaction via a physical button with interrupt handling.

## Main Components
### Microcontroller
- **STM32F103C8**: 32-bit microcontroller with ARM Cortex-M3 core
- Clock frequency: up to 72 MHz
- Built-in Flash memory: 64 KB
- RAM: 20 KB

### LSM6DS3
The LSM6DS3 is a system-in-package featuring a 3D
digital accelerometer and a 3D digital gyroscope
performing at 1.25 mA (up to 1.6 kHz ODR) in highperformance mode and enabling always-on low-power
features for an optimal motion experience for the
consumer.
